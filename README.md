# Predicting Serious Injury in Vehicle Collisions

## Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a motor vehicle collision will result in a **serious outcome** (injury or fatality), enabling **proactive risk mitigation** and **resource planning** by the Department of Transportation (DOT).

---

## Dataset Summary
- **Source**: NYC Vehicle Collision Dataset
- **Size**: 2.1 million rows
- **Target**: `SERIOUS_CRASH` (1 = injury/fatality, 0 = non-serious)
- **Features Used**:
  - Time: `HOUR`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, `IS_WEEKEND`, `IS_LATE_NIGHT`
  - Location: `BOROUGH_STREET_RISK`
  - Vehicle context: `IS_BIKE_INVOLVED`

## Why These Metrics Are Acceptable

In this project:
- The data is **imbalanced** (non-serious crashes far outnumber serious ones)
- **Accuracy alone is misleading** ‚Äî a model could achieve 73% accuracy by predicting all zeros
- Our focus is on **Recall for Class 1 (Serious Crashes)**:
  - XGBoost achieves **64.6% recall**, meaning it identifies **~2 out of 3 serious crashes**
- This helps **minimize missed high-risk cases**, which is critical for emergency response

Some loss in precision is acceptable in safety-critical applications ‚Äî **it's better to over-alert than to miss real danger**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases for DOT

- ** Real-Time Triage**: Prioritize emergency response for high-risk crashes
- ** Hotspot Detection**: Use KMeans clustering to find streets needing design changes
- ** Policy Guidance**: Plan driver awareness campaigns and infrastructure improvements

---

## Conclusion

- The model helps identify serious crashes with good recall
- **XGBoost** offers the best balance of precision and recall
- Ready for integration with crash reporting tools, dashboards, or alert systems

---

## Next Steps

- Deploy via a real-time alert API or dashboard
- Host folium/pydeck crash maps
- Explore multi-label injury prediction (pedestrian vs cyclist vs motorist)
- Share insights with traffic engineers and city planners
